GENERAL PLATFORM QUESTIONS
================================================================================

Q: What is HaDirot?
A: HaDirot means "The Apartments" in Hebrew. We're a rental property marketplace that connects landlords and real estate agents with people looking for rental homes. Our tagline is "The Heart of Local Rentals - Where your family finds their next home." We focus on serving the local community with quality rental listings.

Q: Who can use HaDirot?
A: Anyone can browse our listings without an account! To post listings, save favorites, or contact property owners, you'll need to create a free account. We serve three types of users: Tenants (looking for rentals), Landlords (posting their own properties), and Real Estate Agents (posting on behalf of their agency).

Q: Is HaDirot free to use?
A: Yes! Browsing listings is completely free. Creating an account and posting listings is also free. We don't charge tenants any fees, and we don't allow listings with tenant broker fees on our platform.

Q: What neighborhoods does HaDirot serve?
A: We primarily serve Midwood, Homecrest, Marine Park, Flatbush, Gravesend, and Boro Park. However, you can also list or search for properties in other neighborhoods by entering a custom neighborhood name.

Q: Do I need an account to browse listings?
A: No! You can browse all active listings, use search filters, and view listing details without creating an account. However, to save favorites, contact property owners, or post your own listings, you'll need to sign up for a free account.

Q: How does HaDirot make money?
A: HaDirot offers optional paid features like featuring your listing to get more visibility. However, basic listing posting and browsing are completely free.

================================================================================
BROWSING AND SEARCHING FOR PROPERTIES
================================================================================

Q: How do I search for rental properties?
A: Click "Browse Listings" or "Find Yours" on the home page. You'll see all available properties. Use the filters at the top of the page to narrow down your search by bedrooms, price range, neighborhood, parking, and more.

Q: What filters are available when browsing listings?
A: You can filter by: number of bedrooms (Studio to 5+ bedrooms), poster type (owner vs agent), specific agency name, property type (apartment in building, apartment in house, or full house), price range (minimum and maximum), parking availability, "no fee only" option, and neighborhoods. You can select multiple neighborhoods at once.

Q: How do the featured listings work?
A: Featured listings appear with a yellow star badge and get extra visibility by being placed prominently in the browse grid. They appear at specific positions throughout the browse page to ensure you see them. Featured status lasts for 30 days.

Q: Can I save listings to view later?
A: Yes! If you have an account and are signed in, click the heart icon on any listing card or listing detail page to save it to your favorites. You can view all your saved listings by clicking "My Favorites" in your dashboard.

Q: How do I contact a property owner?
A: On any listing detail page, you'll see the contact information on the right side (or below the photos on mobile). You can either call the phone number directly or click "Send Message" to send an SMS. You don't need an account to view contact info and reach out.

Q: What does "Call for Price" mean?
A: Some property owners prefer to discuss pricing directly rather than listing a specific amount. When you see "Call for Price," you'll need to contact the owner by phone to learn about the rental price.

Q: How many listings are shown per page?
A: We show 20 listings per page. You'll see page numbers at the bottom to navigate through all available properties. Your filters stay active as you move between pages.

Q: Why do I see some of the same featured listings on different pages?
A: Featured listings rotate across different pages to ensure they get fair exposure throughout the browse experience. This means you might see the same featured property appear on multiple pages.

Q: Can I sort the listings?
A: Currently, listings are sorted to show the most recent properties first, with featured listings interspersed at prominent positions. This ensures you see both the newest properties and the highlighted ones.

Q: What happens to my filters when I click on a listing?
A: Your filters are saved! When you return to the browse page using the "Back to Browse" link, you'll see the same filters and page position you left off at.

================================================================================
CREATING AN ACCOUNT
================================================================================

Q: How do I create an account?
A: Click "Sign In" in the top right corner, then select "Sign Up" on the authentication page. You'll need to provide your email, create a password, enter your full name, phone number (optional but recommended), and select your role (Tenant, Landlord, or Real Estate Agent).

Q: What roles can I choose from?
A: You can choose from three roles: Tenant (looking for a place to rent), Landlord (posting your own properties), or Real Estate Agent (posting properties on behalf of your agency). Each role gives you different features on the platform.

Q: What's the difference between the user roles?
A: Tenants can browse, save favorites, and contact owners. Landlords can do everything tenants can, plus post and manage their own property listings. Real Estate Agents get all landlord features plus the ability to create an agency profile page with custom branding and track agency-level analytics.

Q: Can I change my role later?
A: Yes! Go to Account Settings from your dashboard and you can change your role at any time. If you're switching to Real Estate Agent, you'll need to provide your agency name.

Q: How do I reset my password?
A: On the sign-in page, look for the "Forgot Password?" or password reset link. Enter your email address, and we'll send you a secure link to reset your password.

Q: What information do I need to provide when signing up?
A: You'll need a valid email address, a password (at least 6 characters), your full name, and your role. Phone number is optional but helpful for landlords and agents who will receive inquiries.

================================================================================
POSTING A LISTING (LANDLORDS & AGENTS)
================================================================================

Q: How do I post a property listing?
A: Sign in to your account, click "Post Listing" or the "+" icon in your dashboard, and fill out the listing form with your property details. Required information includes property title, cross streets, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, monthly rent (or "Call for Price"), property type, and your contact information.

Q: What information is required to post a listing?
A: You must provide: a property title, cross streets (location), number of bedrooms (including Studio option), number of bathrooms, monthly rent amount OR select "Call for Price," property type (apartment in building/house or full house), your contact name, and your contact phone number.

Q: What information is optional when posting?
A: Optional fields include: neighborhood, property description, square footage, floor number, lease length, parking details, amenities (washer/dryer hookup, dishwasher), whether heat is included, and property photos.

Q: Can I save my listing as a draft?
A: Yes! The listing form automatically saves your progress every 2 seconds. If you close the page or navigate away, your draft will be there when you come back. You don't need to be signed in for the draft to save initially, but you'll need to sign in to publish it.

Q: How many photos can I upload?
A: You can upload up to 10 photos per listing. Each photo can be up to 8MB in size. We recommend uploading high-quality photos that showcase your property's best features.

Q: What if I don't have photos of my property?
A: No problem! If you don't upload any photos, we'll automatically display a tasteful stock photo on your public listing. However, listings with real photos typically get more interest from potential tenants.

Q: What photo is shown as the main image?
A: The first photo you upload is automatically set as the featured image that appears in search results. You can change which photo is featured by clicking "Set Featured" on any of your uploaded images.

Q: What size should my listing photos be?
A: Each photo must be under 8MB. If your photos are larger, our system will automatically compress them to meet the size requirement while maintaining good quality.

Q: Can I edit my listing after posting?
A: Yes! Go to your Dashboard, find your listing, and click the "Edit" button (pencil icon). You can update any information including photos, price, description, and amenities.

Q: Why isn't my listing showing up immediately?
A: All new listings go through a quick approval process to ensure quality and accuracy. This helps maintain a high standard for all properties on HaDirot. Your listing will become visible once it's been reviewed and approved.

Q: How long does it take for my listing to be approved?
A: Most listings are reviewed and approved within 24 hours. You'll receive an email notification once your listing is approved and live on the site.

Q: What does "Call for Price" mean and when should I use it?
A: Select "Call for Price" instead of entering a monthly rent amount if you prefer to discuss pricing directly with potential tenants. This is useful when rent is negotiable or varies based on lease terms.

Q: Can I post a listing with a broker fee?
A: No. HaDirot does not allow listings that charge tenants a broker fee. Our platform is designed to connect renters with no-fee apartments. If your listing requires a tenant broker fee, it cannot be posted on HaDirot.

Q: What property types can I list?
A: You can list three types of properties: "Apartment in a Building," "Apartment in a House," or "Full House." Choose the option that best describes your rental property.

Q: What lease lengths can I specify?
A: You can specify Short Term, 1 Year, 18 Months, or 2 Years lease length. This is optional but helps set expectations with potential tenants.

================================================================================
MANAGING YOUR LISTINGS
================================================================================

Q: How do I view my posted listings?
A: Sign in and go to your Dashboard. You'll see all your listings in a table format showing photos, property details, current status, posting date, and quick action buttons.

Q: What information can I see about my listings in the dashboard?
A: For each listing, you can see the property title, price, number of impressions (how many times people saw it while browsing), direct views (how many times people clicked to see the full details), status (Active/Inactive), approval status, and whether it's featured.

Q: What are "impressions" and "direct views"?
A: Impressions show how many times your listing appeared in someone's search results and was visible on their screen. Direct views show how many times someone actually clicked on your listing to see the full property details. These metrics help you understand how much interest your property is getting.

Q: How do I edit a listing?
A: From your Dashboard, find the listing you want to edit and click the "Edit" button (pencil icon). Make your changes and click "Save" at the bottom of the form.

Q: Can I unpublish a listing temporarily?
A: Yes! In your Dashboard, click the eye-with-slash icon next to your listing. This makes it inactive (not visible to the public) but keeps all the information saved. You can republish it anytime by clicking the refresh icon.

Q: How do I renew an old listing?
A: If your listing is inactive, you can republish it by clicking the refresh/circular arrow icon in your Dashboard. This updates the posting date and makes it active again.

Q: How do I delete a listing?
A: In your Dashboard, click the trash can icon next to the listing you want to remove. You'll be asked to confirm the deletion. Note: This action cannot be undone, so make sure you really want to delete it permanently.

Q: What does it mean when a listing is "Featured"?
A: Featured listings get extra visibility with a yellow star badge and appear in prominent positions when people browse properties. Featured status lasts for 30 days and helps your property stand out.

Q: How do I feature my listing?
A: In your Dashboard, click the star icon next to the listing you want to feature. Note: You may have a limit on how many listings you can feature at once depending on your account level. If you've reached your limit, you'll need to unfeature another listing first.

Q: How long does featured status last?
A: Featured status lasts for 30 days from the time you activate it. After 30 days, the listing will automatically return to standard status. You can always feature it again if you have available featured slots.

Q: Can I see when my featured status will expire?
A: Yes, featured listings in your Dashboard show an expiration date. You can see exactly when your featured status will end.

Q: What happens when my listing gets close to its expiration date?
A: HaDirot has an automatic system that helps manage listing lifecycles. You may receive email reminders before your listing becomes inactive, giving you a chance to renew or update it.

Q: Why does my listing say "Pending Approval"?
A: This means your listing has been submitted and is waiting to be reviewed by our team. Once approved, this status will change to "Active" and your listing will be visible to everyone.

================================================================================
FAVORITES
================================================================================

Q: How do I save a listing as a favorite?
A: While browsing or viewing a listing detail page, click the heart icon. The heart will turn red, indicating the listing has been added to your favorites. You must be signed in to save favorites.

Q: Where can I see my saved favorites?
A: Click on "My Favorites" or the heart icon in your navigation menu. You'll see all the listings you've saved in one convenient place.

Q: Can I remove a listing from my favorites?
A: Yes! Click the heart icon again on any favorited listing (either in your Favorites page or on the listing itself). The heart will turn gray and the listing will be removed from your favorites.

Q: What happens if a listing I favorited gets deleted?
A: Deleted listings are automatically removed from your favorites. You won't see them in your Favorites page anymore.

Q: Is there a limit to how many listings I can favorite?
A: No, there's no limit! Save as many properties as you'd like to compare and come back to later.

================================================================================
ACCOUNT SETTINGS
================================================================================

Q: How do I update my profile information?
A: Click on your name or profile icon, then select "Account Settings." Here you can update your full name, phone number, role, and agency name (if you're an agent).

Q: Can I change my email address?
A: Your email address is tied to your account login and cannot be changed through Account Settings. If you need to change your email, you would need to create a new account with the new email address.

Q: How do I update my phone number?
A: Go to Account Settings, update the phone number field, and click "Save Changes." This phone number will be displayed on any listings you post.

Q: What if I'm a real estate agent - how do I add my agency name?
A: In Account Settings, make sure your role is set to "Real Estate Agent." You'll then see an Agency Name field where you can enter your agency. This name must be unique - if another agent is already using that agency name, you'll need to choose something different or coordinate with them.

Q: Can I change my password?
A: Yes! In Account Settings, scroll down to the "Change Password" section. Enter your current password, then your new password twice to confirm. Click "Update Password" to save the change.

Q: How secure is my password?
A: Passwords must be at least 6 characters long. We recommend using a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols for better security. Your password is encrypted and stored securely.

Q: What happens if I change my role from Agent to Landlord?
A: If you change from Real Estate Agent to Landlord or Tenant, your agency information will be cleared. Any agency profile you created will remain, but you'll lose access to manage it unless you're granted special agency management permissions.

================================================================================
AGENCY PROFILES AND BRANDING (REAL ESTATE AGENTS)
================================================================================

Q: What is an agency profile?
A: An agency profile is a dedicated public page for your real estate agency. It showcases your agency's branding (logo and banner), contact information, about section, and all your active listings. Think of it as your agency's mini-website on HaDirot.

Q: Who can create an agency profile?
A: Real estate agents can create agency profiles. However, you need special "agency management" permission to create and customize your agency page. Contact support if you're an agent and need this access enabled.

Q: How do I set up my agency profile?
A: Once you have agency management permissions, go to "Agency Settings" from your dashboard. If you don't have an agency profile yet, you'll be prompted to create one by entering your agency name. After creating it, you can customize your branding and information.

Q: What can I customize on my agency page?
A: You can customize your agency's display name, upload a logo, upload a banner image, add contact information (phone, email, website), and write an "About" section describing your agency, experience, and services.

Q: How do I upload a logo and banner?
A: In Agency Settings, you'll see sections for Logo and Banner. Click "Upload Logo" or "Upload Banner" and select an image from your computer. For best results, use a square PNG with transparent background for the logo, and a 1200x400 pixel image for the banner.

Q: What size should my agency logo and banner be?
A: We recommend a square logo image with transparent background (PNG format). For the banner, use a 1200x400 pixel JPG or PNG. Images can be up to 8MB each.

Q: How do I edit my agency's "About" section?
A: In Agency Settings, scroll to the "About" section. You'll see a rich text editor where you can format your text with bold, italics, headings, bullet lists, numbered lists, and hyperlinks. Write about your agency's mission, experience, specialties, or anything that helps potential clients get to know you.

Q: Can I add links to my agency's About section?
A: Yes! Use the link button in the editor toolbar to add clickable links. This is great for linking to your main website, social media, or other resources.

Q: Where is my agency page located?
A: Your agency page has a unique URL based on your agency name. For example, if your agency is "Sunrise Realty," your URL might be hadirot.com/agencies/sunrise-realty. You can find your exact URL in Agency Settings.

Q: Can people find my agency page through search engines?
A: Currently, agency pages are available by direct link only. They're not publicly listed on HaDirot's browse pages or indexed for search engines. You'll need to share your agency URL directly with potential clients.

Q: How do I share my agency page?
A: In Agency Settings, you'll see your public agency link with a "Copy Link" button. Click this to copy the URL, then share it via email, text message, social media, or add it to your business cards.

Q: How do I track views on my agency page?
A: Agency Settings shows you two metrics: views in the last 30 days and all-time views. This helps you understand how much traffic your agency page is getting.

Q: Can I change my agency name?
A: Your agency display name is managed through your Account Settings (not Agency Settings). Go to Account Settings, make sure your role is "Real Estate Agent," and update your agency name there. This change will sync with your agency profile. Note: The new name must be unique and not already in use by another agency on HaDirot.

Q: What if my agency name is already taken?
A: Agency names must be unique on HaDirot. If the name you want is already in use, you'll see an error message. You can either choose a different name (try adding your location or a descriptor) or contact the other agency to coordinate if you're actually part of the same organization.

Q: Can multiple agents work under the same agency?
A: Yes! If multiple agents work for the same agency, you'll need to coordinate who creates and manages the main agency profile. The agent with agency management permissions should set it up, and other agents can use the same agency name in their Account Settings to be associated with it.

Q: What's the difference between the agency name in Account Settings and Agency Settings?
A: The agency name in Account Settings is your affiliation - it appears on your listings and profile. Agency Settings is where you customize the look and content of your public agency page. The two should match, but they're managed in different places.

Q: Do my listings automatically show on my agency page?
A: Yes! Once your agency profile is set up and you have listings posted with your agency name, those listings will automatically appear on your agency page. Potential clients can see all your agency's active properties in one place.

Q: Can I remove my logo or banner after uploading?
A: Yes! In Agency Settings, you'll see a "Remove" button next to each uploaded image. Click this to delete the logo or banner. You can always upload a new one later.

Q: How often should I update my agency profile?
A: It's good practice to review your agency profile every few months to ensure your contact information, about section, and branding are current. Update it whenever you have new information to share or want to refresh your agency's image.

================================================================================
LISTING DETAILS PAGE
================================================================================

Q: What information is shown on a listing detail page?
A: The listing detail page shows all property information including photos (in a carousel), title, location, neighborhood, price, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, square footage, property type, floor number, amenities (parking, washer/dryer, dishwasher, heat), lease length, full description, and contact information.

Q: How do I contact the property owner from the listing page?
A: On the right side of the page (or below photos on mobile), you'll see a contact card with the owner's name, phone number, and two buttons: "Call Now" and "Send Message." Click "Call Now" to dial directly, or "Send Message" to open your SMS app with a pre-filled message.

Q: What are similar listings?
A: At the bottom of each listing page, you'll see a "Similar Listings" section showing other properties with the same number of bedrooms in the same neighborhood. This helps you compare options.

Q: Can I view the property owner's agency page?
A: If the listing is posted by a real estate agent, you'll see their agency name displayed. If they have an agency profile set up, you can click on the agency name to visit their agency page and see all their listings.

Q: Can I share a listing with someone?
A: Yes! Simply copy the URL from your browser's address bar and share it. Each listing has a unique URL that goes directly to that property's detail page.

Q: What does the heart icon do on the listing page?
A: The heart icon lets you save the listing to your favorites. Click it to add the property to your favorites list. You must be signed in to use this feature.

Q: What happens if I click on a listing from my browse search?
A: When you click on a listing and then return to browse using the "Back to Browse" button, you'll return to the same page and filters you were using. This makes it easy to continue browsing where you left off.

================================================================================

Q: Why did I receive a welcome email?
A: We send a welcome email when you create your account to confirm your registration and help you get started with HaDirot.

================================================================================
TECHNICAL QUESTIONS
================================================================================

Q: My listing draft disappeared - where did it go?
A: If you created a draft before signing in, it's stored in your browser. The draft is linked to your computer and browser. If you switch devices or browsers, you won't see it. Sign in before starting your listing to ensure your draft is saved to your account. If you created a draft while signed out and then signed in, the draft should automatically migrate to your account.

Q: Why can't I upload my images?
A: Make sure each image is under 8MB and in a common image format (JPG, PNG). You must also be signed in to upload images. If problems persist, try using a different browser or check your internet connection.

Q: How large can my property photos be?
A: Each photo must be 8MB or smaller. If your photos are larger, try reducing their resolution or use our automatic compression which will optimize them for you.

Q: The website is asking me to sign in - why?
A: Certain features require an account for security and functionality: posting listings, uploading images, saving favorites, and managing your properties. Browsing and viewing listings are always free without signing in.

Q: I can't find my listing on the browse page - why not?
A: Check your listing status in your Dashboard. If it says "Pending Approval," it hasn't been reviewed yet. If it says "Inactive," you'll need to republish it. If it's "Active" but you still can't find it, try clearing your search filters or check that you're looking in the right page range.

Q: Why do my filters reset sometimes?
A: Filters are saved in your browsing session. If you close your browser, clear your browsing data, or open HaDirot in a new window, your filters will reset. The filters persist as long as you stay on the site and use the "Back to Browse" button from listing pages.

Q: Can I use HaDirot on my phone?
A: Yes! HaDirot is fully responsive and works great on mobile phones and tablets. All features are available on mobile, with layouts optimized for smaller screens.

Q: What browsers does HaDirot support?
A: HaDirot works on all modern browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. For the best experience, make sure you're using an up-to-date version of your browser.

Q: Why is the image upload taking so long?
A: Large image files (close to 8MB) take longer to upload, especially on slower internet connections. Our system also compresses images automatically to optimize them, which adds a few seconds. Be patient and don't close the page during upload.

Q: What if I accidentally deleted my listing?
A: Unfortunately, listing deletions are permanent and cannot be undone. You'll need to create a new listing with the same information. This is why we recommend using the "Unpublish" feature instead of deleting if you might want the listing back later.

================================================================================
GETTING STARTED GUIDES
================================================================================

Q: I'm a tenant looking for an apartment - where do I start?
A: Click "Browse Listings" or "Find Yours" on the home page. Use the filters to narrow down by bedrooms, price range, and neighborhood. When you find properties you like, click the heart icon to save them to your favorites (you'll need to create a free account). Then use the contact information on each listing to reach out directly to property owners.

Q: I'm a landlord wanting to list my property - what should I do first?

Review everything and submit - your listing will be reviewed and approved within 24 hours. You'll receive an email when it goes live!

Q: I'm a real estate agent - how do I get started on HaDirot?
A: Create an account and select "Real Estate Agent" as your role. Enter your agency name in Account Settings. Start posting your available properties using the "Post Listing" feature. If you want to create a branded agency page, you'll need agency management permissions - contact support to get this enabled, then go to Agency Settings to customize your agency profile.

Q: What's the first thing I should do after creating my account?
A: After signing up, complete your profile in Account Settings (add your phone number if you didn't already). If you're a landlord or agent, you can start posting listings right away. If you're a tenant, start browsing and save your favorite properties!

Q: How can I make my listing stand out?
A: Upload high-quality photos showing your property's best features, write a detailed description highlighting unique amenities and neighborhood benefits, keep your listing information accurate and up-to-date, and consider featuring your listing to get prominent placement in search results.

Q: What should I include in my listing description?
A: Describe the property's features, mention nearby amenities (public transit, schools, shopping), highlight special features (renovated kitchen, large closets, natural light), explain what's included in rent (utilities, parking), and note any important details like move-in date, lease terms, or pet policies.

Q: How do I get more inquiries on my listing?
A: Make sure you have multiple clear photos, provide complete property information, respond quickly to inquiries, keep your contact information up-to-date, price competitively for your neighborhood, and consider featuring your listing for extra visibility.

Q: What makes a good listing photo?
A: Good lighting (natural light is best), clean and uncluttered rooms, multiple angles of each room, photos of special features (updated kitchen, nice bathroom, outdoor space), and the exterior/building entrance. Make sure photos are in focus and well-framed.

================================================================================
COMMON SCENARIOS AND TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

Q: I posted my listing but haven't gotten any inquiries yet - what should I do?
A: First, make sure your listing is approved and active (check your Dashboard). Review your listing to ensure photos are clear, the price is competitive, and contact information is correct. Consider if your description is detailed enough. Check your phone and email to make sure you're not missing inquiries. If your listing has been active for a while, you might want to refresh it or consider featuring it for more visibility.

Q: Someone inquired about my listing - what should I do?
A: Respond as quickly as possible! Fast responses show professionalism and help you connect with serious renters. Have information ready about showing times, move-in requirements, lease terms, and application process. Be prepared to answer questions about the neighborhood, utilities, parking, and property features.

Q: I need to change the rent price on my listing - how?
A: Go to your Dashboard, click "Edit" on your listing, update the price field, and save your changes. The new price will appear immediately on your listing.

Q: My property is no longer available - what do I do?
A: Congratulations on renting it! Go to your Dashboard and either unpublish the listing (eye-with-slash icon) or delete it (trash icon). Unpublishing keeps the listing data in case you need to relist it later, while deleting removes it permanently.

Q: I want to list a property in a neighborhood that's not in the dropdown - can I?
A: Yes! Select "Other (type below)" from the neighborhood dropdown and type in your custom neighborhood name. This gives you flexibility to list properties in any area.

Q: Can I post the same property twice?
A: You shouldn't post duplicate listings for the same property. If you need to update information, edit your existing listing instead. Duplicate listings may be removed during our review process.

Q: What if I made a mistake in my listing after it was approved?
A: No problem! Just go to your Dashboard, click "Edit" on the listing, make your corrections, and save. Your listing will remain active while you edit it.

Q: How do I know if someone viewed my listing?
A: Check your Dashboard - each listing shows "Impressions" (how many times it appeared in search results) and "Direct Views" (how many times someone clicked to see the full details). These metrics update in real-time.

Q: My agency name keeps saying it's already taken - what can I do?
A: Try adding your location or a descriptor to make it unique, like "Sunrise Realty Brooklyn" instead of just "Sunrise Realty." If you believe you should have access to an existing agency profile (because you work there), contact the agency owner or support for help.

Q: Can I post commercial properties or just residential?
A: HaDirot is focused on residential rentals (apartments and houses). Commercial properties are not currently supported on the platform.

Q: Is there a way to boost my listing without featuring it?
A: The main way to get extra visibility is through featuring. You can also renew your listing periodically to refresh its posting date, or make sure you have high-quality photos and a complete description to attract more attention naturally.
