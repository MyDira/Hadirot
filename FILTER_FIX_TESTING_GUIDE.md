# Filter Persistence Fix - Testing Guide

## What Was Fixed

### Root Cause
The `hasInitialized.current` guard in `useBrowseFilters.ts` was preventing the effect from re-running after URL parameters were updated during sessionStorage restoration. This caused:
- Visual filter state to show correctly (from initial state restoration)
- But listings to be fetched with empty/stale filters (because URL parsing was blocked)

### Solution Implemented
1. **Refactored initialization logic** to allow URL parameter re-parsing after sessionStorage restoration
2. **Added `isRestoringFromSession` ref** to coordinate timing between restoration and URL parsing
3. **Created `parseFiltersFromURL` function** to centralize URL parameter parsing logic
4. **Added comprehensive console logging** to track filter state through the restoration process

### Key Changes

#### `src/hooks/useBrowseFilters.ts`
- Added `isRestoringFromSession` ref to track restoration state
- Created `parseFiltersFromURL` callback for centralized URL parsing
- Modified initialization useEffect to:
  - Restore from sessionStorage on first mount when returning from detail page
  - Skip URL parsing during restoration (first 50ms after restoration starts)
  - Parse from URL after restoration completes or on normal navigation
- Added console logs: `üîÑ Restoring filters from sessionStorage` and `üìã Parsing filters from URL`

#### `src/pages/BrowseListings.tsx`
- Added console logs to track when listings are loaded: `üîç BrowseListings: Loading listings with filters`
- Added console log before fetching: `üì¶ BrowseListings: Fetching with service filters`

#### `src/components/listings/ListingFilters.tsx`
- Added console log to track filter prop changes: `üéõÔ∏è ListingFilters: Received filters prop`

## How to Test

### Setup
1. Open your browser's Developer Console (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
2. Navigate to the Browse page: http://localhost:5173/browse
3. Keep the console open to monitor the log messages

### Test 1: Single Filter - Bedrooms

## Console Log Patterns

### Successful Filter Restoration
```
üîÑ Restoring filters from sessionStorage: {bedrooms: 2}
üéõÔ∏è ListingFilters: Received filters prop: {bedrooms: 2}
üîç BrowseListings: Loading listings with filters: {bedrooms: 2} page: 1
üì¶ BrowseListings: Fetching with service filters: {bedrooms: 2, noFeeOnly: undefined}
```

### Fresh Page Load (No Restoration)
```
üìã Parsing filters from URL: {bedrooms: 2}
üéõÔ∏è ListingFilters: Received filters prop: {bedrooms: 2}
üîç BrowseListings: Loading listings with filters: {bedrooms: 2} page: 1
üì¶ BrowseListings: Fetching with service filters: {bedrooms: 2, noFeeOnly: undefined}
```

### Incorrect Behavior (Bug Present)
```
üîÑ Restoring filters from sessionStorage: {bedrooms: 2}
üîç BrowseListings: Loading listings with filters: {} page: 1
üì¶ BrowseListings: Fetching with service filters: {noFeeOnly: undefined}
```
‚ùå This would indicate filters are NOT being applied to the fetch

## Troubleshooting

### If filters still don't work:
1. **Check console logs** - Look for the emoji patterns above
2. **Verify sessionStorage** - In console, run: `sessionStorage.getItem('browse_state')`
3. **Check URL parameters** - Ensure URL has filter params after navigation
4. **Clear browser cache** - Sometimes cached state interferes
5. **Check for console errors** - Look for red error messages

### Common Issues:
- **Empty filters in fetch**: The coordination mechanism failed
- **Filters show but listings don't match**: State/URL synchronization issue
- **Filters disappear**: sessionStorage was cleared or blocked
- **Multiple fetches**: Effect dependencies may need adjustment

## Success Criteria

### ‚úÖ All Tests Pass When:
1. Filters persist visually after navigation (UI shows correct values)
2. Listings actually match the filters (data is correctly filtered)
3. Console logs show correct filter values throughout the flow
4. URL parameters match the active filters
5. No JavaScript errors in console
6. Works on both desktop and mobile layouts
7. Works across all filter types: bedrooms, price, neighborhoods, poster type, property type
8. Pagination works with filters
9. Rapid navigation doesn't break filter persistence
10. Clear filters works correctly after restoration

## Reporting Issues

If any test fails, please provide:
1. Which test failed (test number and name)
2. Screenshot or copy of console logs
3. Browser and version (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
4. Desktop or mobile view
5. Any error messages in console
6. URL shown in address bar when bug occurs

## Next Steps

After testing confirms all filters work:
1. Remove debug console logs from production code (optional)
2. Consider adding automated tests for this functionality
3. Monitor for any edge cases in production
4. Consider adding user-facing feedback during filter restoration
