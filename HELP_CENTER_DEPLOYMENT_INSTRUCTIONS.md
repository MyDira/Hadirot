# Help Center Deployment Instructions

## Current Status

✅ **COMPLETED:**
- 7 categories created in database
- 3 "Getting Started" articles inserted
- All migration files prepared and validated
- Project builds successfully

⏳ **REMAINING:**
- 18 articles across 3 categories need to be inserted

## What's Been Done

### 1. Categories Created (7 total)
All 7 categories are live in the database:
- Getting Started (Rocket icon)
- Managing Listings (Settings icon)
- For Tenants (Users icon)
- For Agents & Landlords (Briefcase icon)
- Safety & Trust (Shield icon)
- Technical Help (Wrench icon)
- Contact & Feedback (MessageCircle icon)

### 2. Articles Inserted (3 of 21)
Getting Started category is complete:
- Creating an account
- Posting your first listing
- Understanding account types

## Remaining Work

You need to execute 3 more migration files to insert the remaining 18 articles.

### Option 1: Using Supabase Dashboard (RECOMMENDED)

1. Log into your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Execute each file in order:

**File 1:** `supabase/migrations/20251022000001_populate_help_center_part2.sql`
- Contains 6 articles (Managing Listings: 3, For Tenants: 3)

**File 2:** `supabase/migrations/20251022000002_populate_help_center_part3.sql`
- Contains 5 articles (For Agents & Landlords: 3, Safety & Trust: 2)

**File 3:** `supabase/migrations/20251022000003_populate_help_center_part4.sql`
- Contains 7 articles (Safety & Trust: 1, Technical Help: 3, Contact & Feedback: 3)

### Option 2: Using Supabase CLI

If you have Supabase CLI installed:

```bash
cd /tmp/cc-agent/54127071/project
supabase db push
```

This will apply all pending migrations.

### Option 3: Manual SQL Execution

The SQL content is also available in cleaned format in `/tmp`:
- `/tmp/clean_migration2.sql` (6 articles)
- `/tmp/clean_migration3.sql` (5 articles)
- `/tmp/clean_migration4.sql` (7 articles)

## Verification

After applying the migrations, verify with this SQL:

```sql
SELECT
  c.name as category,
  COUNT(a.id) as article_count
FROM knowledge_base_categories c
LEFT JOIN knowledge_base_articles a ON a.category_id = c.id
GROUP BY c.id, c.name
ORDER BY c.sort_order;
```

Expected result:
| Category | Article Count |
|----------|---------------|
| Getting Started | 3 |
| Managing Listings | 3 |
| For Tenants | 3 |
| For Agents & Landlords | 3 |
| Safety & Trust | 3 |
| Technical Help | 3 |
| Contact & Feedback | 3 |

**Total: 7 categories, 21 articles**

## Testing the Help Center

Once all migrations are applied:

1. **Visit Help Center:**
   ```
   http://your-site.com/help
   ```

2. **Check Categories:**
   - All 7 categories should be visible
   - Each with proper icon and description

3. **Read Articles:**
   - Click any category to see its 3 articles
   - Click articles to read full content
   - Verify formatting looks good

4. **Test Features:**
   - Search functionality
   - Article view counting
   - Helpful/not helpful voting (if logged in)

## Post-Deployment Tasks

1. **Update Placeholders:**
   - Replace `support@example.com` with actual email
   - Replace `+1-555-RENTALS` with actual WhatsApp number
   - Add real URLs for `[link]` placeholders
   - Update `yoursite.com` references

2. **SEO Optimization:**
   - Add meta descriptions if needed
   - Verify URLs are clean and working

3. **Monitor Usage:**
   - Track which articles get most views
   - Review helpful/not helpful feedback
   - Update content based on user needs

## File Locations

- **Migration Files:** `supabase/migrations/202510220000*.sql`
- **Help UI:** `src/pages/HelpCenter.tsx`, `HelpCategory.tsx`, `HelpArticle.tsx`
- **Service Layer:** `src/services/knowledgeBase.ts`
- **Routes:** Already configured in `src/App.tsx`

## Need Help?

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Supabase logs for SQL errors
2. Verify RLS policies are properly set
3. Ensure all UUIDs/foreign keys are valid
4. Check browser console for frontend errors
