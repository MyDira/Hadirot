## How to Complete

### Option 1: Supabase Dashboard (Easiest)
1. Open your **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Go to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy content from `supabase/migrations/20251022000002_populate_help_center_part3.sql`
4. Paste and click **Run**
5. Copy content from `supabase/migrations/20251022000003_populate_help_center_part4.sql`
6. Paste and click **Run**

### Option 2: Combined File (Fastest)
I've created a combined file at `/tmp/combined_final_migrations.sql` containing both migrations (12 inserts total).

Execute it in your Supabase SQL Editor in one go.

## Verification

After running, verify with this SQL:

```sql
SELECT
  c.name as category,
  COUNT(a.id) as articles
FROM knowledge_base_categories c
LEFT JOIN knowledge_base_articles a ON a.category_id = c.id
GROUP BY c.id, c.name
ORDER BY c.sort_order;
```

Expected result:

| Getting Started | 3 |
