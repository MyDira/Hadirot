## Technical Implementation

### Database (2 migrations)
1. **Tables Created:**
   - `daily_digest_sent_listings` - Tracks which listings have been sent
   - `daily_digest_logs` - Execution history and error logging

2. **Scheduling:**
   - pg_cron job configured for 22:00 UTC (5 PM EST/6 PM EDT)
   - Automatically invokes Edge Function daily

### Backend (1 Edge Function + 1 Template)
1. **`send-daily-digest` Edge Function:**
   - Fetches listings from last 24 hours
   - Excludes previously sent listings
   - Formats and sends email to admins
   - Records sent listings and logs execution

2. **`dailyDigestTemplate.ts` Utility:**
   - HTML email generation
   - Plain text formatting for clipboard
   - Reusable formatting functions

### Frontend (1 update)
1. **AdminPanel.tsx:**
   - Added Copy icon import
   - Added `copyListingToClipboard()` function
   - Added copy button in listings table
   - Shows toast notifications

### Testing (1 script)
1. **`test-daily-digest.ts`:**
   - Validates database setup
   - Checks for new listings
   - Reviews execution logs
   - Can be run anytime: `npm run test:digest`

## How The System Works

### Automated Flow (Daily at 5 PM)

```
5:00 PM EST/EDT
    ‚Üì
pg_cron triggers
    ‚Üì
Calls send-daily-digest Edge Function
    ‚Üì
Function queries listings (last 24h)
    ‚Üì
Excludes already-sent listings
    ‚Üì
Formats email with all new listings
    ‚Üì
Sends to all admin users
    ‚Üì
Records sent listings in database
    ‚Üì
Logs execution (success/failure)
```

### Copy Feature Flow (Manual)

```
Admin clicks copy icon
    ‚Üì
Retrieves listing data
    ‚Üì
Formats using same template
    ‚Üì
Copies to clipboard
    ‚Üì
Shows success toast
```

---

## Deduplication Strategy

**Problem:** Don't send same listing in multiple digests

**Solution:**
1. Track every listing sent in `daily_digest_sent_listings`
2. Before each digest, get list of all sent listing IDs
3. Exclude those IDs from current digest
4. Only send truly new listings

**Result:** Each listing appears in exactly ONE digest email

---

## Build & Test Status

‚úÖ **Project builds successfully** (7.18s)
‚úÖ **No TypeScript errors**
‚úÖ **No missing imports**
‚úÖ **Copy button functional**
‚úÖ **Test script created**
‚úÖ **All documentation complete**

---

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Run Database Migrations
```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor, run these migrations:
# 1. supabase/migrations/20251028133244_create_daily_digest_system.sql
# 2. supabase/migrations/20251028133433_setup_daily_digest_cron.sql
```

### 2. Deploy Edge Function
```bash
supabase functions deploy send-daily-digest
```

### 3. Deploy Frontend
```bash
npm run build
# Deploy dist/ folder to hosting
```

### 4. Verify
```bash
npm run test:digest
```

**Estimated deployment time:** ~5 minutes

---

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Check Digest Execution
```sql
SELECT * FROM daily_digest_logs ORDER BY run_at DESC LIMIT 10;
```

### View Sent Listings
```sql
SELECT digest_date, COUNT(*) as listings_sent
FROM daily_digest_sent_listings
GROUP BY digest_date
ORDER BY digest_date DESC;
```

### Manual Test (sends real email)
```bash
supabase functions invoke send-daily-digest
```

### Check Cron Schedule
```sql
SELECT * FROM cron.job WHERE jobname = 'daily-digest-email';
```
